# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Terminal output from running the demo script (`python main.py`). An owner (Sam)
with two pets and five tasks, scheduled against a 75-minute daily budget:

```
================================================
Today's Schedule for Sam
================================================
Daily Plan — 4 scheduled, 1 skipped, 70 min used

Scheduled:
  07:30  Morning walk (Rex) [30min] — high priority; placed at 07:30 with 75 min free
  08:00  Feed breakfast (Rex) [10min] — high priority; placed at 08:00 with 45 min free
  08:10  Clean litter box (Milo) [10min] — medium priority; placed at 08:10 with 35 min free
  08:20  Play session (Milo) [20min] — low priority; placed at 08:20 with 25 min free

Skipped:
  Long afternoon hike (Rex) — needs 90 min but the day only has 75 min total
```

## 🧪 Testing PawPal+

```bash
# Run the full test suite:
pytest

# Run with coverage:
pytest --cov
```

Sample test output:

```
============================= test session starts ==============================

tests/test_pawpal.py::test_add_task_increases_pet_task_count PASSED      [100%]

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

> Fill in once you've implemented scheduling logic.

| Feature | Method(s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Task sorting | | e.g., by priority, duration |
| Filtering | | e.g., skip tasks if time runs out |
| Conflict handling | | e.g., overlapping time slots |
| Recurring tasks | | e.g., daily vs. weekly |
